### Hi, I'm Vincent Ollinger

- I've learned back-end web development on [Boot.dev](https://boot.dev) for 6 months 
- I've been coding in Go primarily
- I also can code in Python and JavaScript
- I'm learning a bit of front-end (HTML/CSS/JS) at the moment

I'm currently on the look out for a role in backend web development, ideally writing Go or Python. I'd especially love to work at a startup on a tight knit team where I can make an impact quickly. If you're hiring, let's chat!
